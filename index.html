    <h1>Fix the facinorous food</h1>
    <p>The Swedish school lunch system are failing to feed 20% of the students every day, with over 40% of the students
        disliking or hating the food according to SVT, Sweden’s government founded mass media company. This leads to
        students not getting enough energy and nutritions to concentrate in class. Having tired students does not only
        affect a few people, it might affect the whole class. Tired students tend to be disturbing others when they’re
        unable to concentrate, which lowers the educational quality for the whole class rather than a few people.</p>

    <p>What we have to do is to pressure the schools to follow the already set standards for the school lunches,
        meaning that it should be good tasting, healthy, environmentally friendly and safe to eat.</p>

    <p>We need to communicate more!
        The most important part is to let the students be the ones to decide if the food tastes good. There should be
        atleast one poll every semester to evaluate the food, ranking the best and worst dishes for the chefs to
        evaluate their menu and remove the disliked dishes, and continue serving the appreciated dishes.</p>

    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>We are a group of 4 passionate students who strives to pressure the Swedish schools to enforce a better food
        standard for the school lunches. We are based in Umeå, Sweden and are founders of the “Make the school lunch
        edible throughout Sweden” campaign. Our journey started after we countless times got served uncooked rice and
        potatoes, way overcooked rice (porridge like), frozen pancakes and frozen hashbrowns for lunch. Since then, we
        have launched this campaign hoping to help improve the lunches in the schools all around Sweden by inspiring
        students to take their stand and communicate more with the chefs about the food.
